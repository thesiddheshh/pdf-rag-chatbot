# üß† PDF RAG Chatbot (React Frontend)

An elegant, highly interactive multi-PDF Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot frontend built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This interface allows users to upload multiple PDF files, chunk and analyze them client-side, and query them using popular LLM providers like **OpenAI**, **Anthropic (Claude)**, and **OpenRouter**. Seamless experience, dark mode, animated gradients, and full support for live document-based Q\&A.

## üìñ Overview

This project implements a **frontend-only** PDF document assistant capable of:

* Uploading and managing multiple PDFs
* Extracting text (via FileReader)
* Chunking documents with overlap
* Finding relevant chunks using cosine-like semantic similarity
* Querying selected document context via LLMs
* Generating contextual, cited answers in a rich, animated chat UI

Ideal use cases:

* Academic research
* Legal document review
* Business intelligence Q\&A
* Student projects using API-based LLMs

## ‚ú® Key Features

### PDF Management

* Upload multiple PDFs via drag-and-drop or file picker
* Persistent state of uploaded files and their metadata
* Select/deselect PDFs for querying
* Remove individual documents

### Text Processing

* Text extraction via `FileReader` (mocked but extensible)
* Overlapping chunking with adjustable parameters
* Lightweight semantic similarity scoring

### LLM Integration

* Works with **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **OpenRouter**
* Dynamic system prompts with citation instructions
* API key stored locally (never sent to server)
* Top-k context chunk retrieval + prompt injection

### Chat Interface

* Timestamped user and assistant messages
* Source chunk citation with filenames and ranges
* Streaming-style loading animation
* Clear chat and download history

### UI/UX

* Tailwind-based layout
* Pastel animated gradients
* Fully responsive dark-mode design
* Modal-based API configuration

## üîê API Integration

### Supported Providers

* OpenAI (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`)
* Anthropic (`claude-3-sonnet`)
* OpenRouter (`mistral-7b-instruct`, etc.)

### API Setup

* Click ‚öôÔ∏è icon to open modal
* Choose provider from dropdown
* Paste API key (saved in local state)
* Keys are used **only client-side**

> ‚ùó You are responsible for securing and monitoring your API key usage.

---

## üé® Customization

* Modify `extractPDFText()` to plug in **PDF.js** or server-side parsing
* Replace `calculateSimilarity()` with real embeddings + cosine similarity
* Add chunk size or overlap sliders in settings
* Integrate Firebase or Supabase for multi-user sessions
* Swap React for Next.js or Remix for SSR support
